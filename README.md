**_This package is still under heavy development._**

It's bundled with [`dnt`](https://github.com/denoland/dnt), so it should work in browsers, Deno and Node.js.

## Installation

For Deno, pick your favorite registry from the following:

- `import uriware from "https://nest.land/package/uriware/index.ts"`
- `import uriware from "https://deno.land/x/uriware/index.ts"`
- `import uriware from "https://esm.sh/uriware"`

For Node.js, just install `uriware` from the npm registry:

- `npm install uriware`
- `pnpm add uriware`
- `yarn add uriware`
